# Course: Introduction to shell

## 1. Summary & Goals

_The Unix command line has survived and thrived for almost 50 years because it lets people do complex things with just a few keystrokes. Sometimes called "the universal glue of programming," it helps users combine existing programs in new ways, automate repetitive tasks, and run programs on clusters and clouds that may be halfway around the world. This course will introduce its key elements and show you how to use them efficiently._

## 2. Core Concepts & Notes

_This is the central index for this course. As I create new atomic notes, I will link them here under the relevant module or topic._

### Chapter 1: Manipulating files and directories

*This chapter is a brief introduction to the Unix shell. You'll learn why it is still in use after almost 50 years, how it compares to the graphical tools you may be more familiar with, how to move around in the shell, and how to create, modify, and delete files and folders.*

- [[Shell - What is Shell]]
- [[Shell - CLI vs GUI]]
- [[Shell - Filesystem Hierarchy]]
- [[Shell - Root Directory]]
- [[Shell - Absolute vs Relative Paths]]
- [[Shell - Working Directory]]
- [[Shell - Path Shortcuts]]
- [[Shell - File Operations]]
- [[Shell - Renaming via Move]]
- [[Shell - Deletion Permanence]]
- [[Shell - rm vs rmdir]]
- [[Shell - Common Commands Cheatsheet]]
- [[Shell - Exercise One]]

### Chapter 2: Manipulating data

*The commands you saw in the previous chapter allowed you to move things around in the filesystem. This chapter will show you how to work with the data in those files. The tools we’ll use are fairly simple, but are solid building blocks.*

- [[Shell - File & Content Inspection]]
- [[Shell - cat Command]]
- [[Shell - less Command]]
- [[Shell - head Command]]
- [[Shell - Command Flags]]
- [[Shell - Data Manipulation]]
- [[Shell - cut Command]]
- [[Shell - Productivity Tools]]
- [[Shell - Tab Completion]]
- [[Shell - Command History]]
- [[Shell - man Command]]
- [[Shell - grep Command]]
- [[Shell - paste Command]]
- [[Shell - head vs cut]]
- [[Shell - cut & paste Relationship]]
- [[Shell - File Inspection & Manipulation Cheatsheet]]
- [[Shell - Exercise Two]]

### Chapter 3: Combining Tools

*The real power of the Unix shell lies not in the individual commands, but in how easily they can be combined to do new things. This chapter will show you how to use this power to select the data you want, and introduce commands for sorting values and removing duplicates.*

- [[Shell - Wildcards]]
- [[Shell - Asterisk Wildcard]]
- [[Shell - Question Mark Wildcard]]
- [[Shell - Square Bracket Wildcard]]
- [[Shell - Curly Bracket Wildcard]]
- [[Shell - sort Command]]
- [[Shell - uniq Command]]
- [[Shell - sort & uniq Relationship]]
- [[Shell - wc Command]]
- [[Shell - Redirection]]
- [[Shell - Pipelines]]
- [[Shell - Redirection & Pipelines Relationship]]
- [[Shell - Stopping Programs]]
- [[Shell - Common Commands Cheatsheet 3]]
- [[Shell - Exercise Three]]

### Chapter 4: Batch processing

*Most shell commands will process many files at once. This chapter shows you how to make your own pipelines do that. Along the way, you will see how the shell uses variables to store information.*

- [[Shell - Variables]]
- [[Shell - Environment Variables]]
- [[Shell - Shell Variables]]
- [[Shell - Accessing Variable Values]]
- [[Shell - Loops]]
- [[Shell - For Loop Syntax]]
- [[Shell - Looping Over Files with Wildcards]]
- [[Shell - Running Multiple Commands in a Loop]]
- [[Shell - Handling Filenames with Spaces]]
- [[Shell - Batch Processing Cheatsheet]]
- [[Shell - Exercise Four]]

### Chapter 5: Creating new tools

*History lets you repeat things with just a few keystrokes, and pipes let you combine existing commands to create new ones. In this chapter, you will see how to go one step further and create new commands of your own.*

- [[Shell - Nano Editor]]
- [[Shell - Shell Scripts]]
- [[Shell - Saving Command History to a Script]]
- [[Shell - Executing Scripts]]
- [[Shell - Script Arguments]]
- [[Shell - The Special Variable]]
- [[Shell - Positional Arguments]]
- [[Shell - Using Loops in Scripts]]
- [[Shell - Script Comments]]
- [[Shell - Troubleshooting Hanging Scripts]]
- [[Shell - Scripting Fundamentals Cheatsheet]]
- [[Shell - Exercise Five]]

## 3. Key Takeaways & Reflections

- **Determine** how commands can be combined using redirection, pipes, and command substitution
- **Identify** how shell scripts, variables, and command-line parameters are used to automate tasks
- **Identify** how to navigate, inspect, and manage files and directories using core Unix shell commands.
- **Recall** how loops, history features, flags, and help systems support efficient shell use
- **Recognize** how to view, filter, and manipulate data using fundamental text-processing tools
