# Core: Cloud Computing Skills Demand
## Summary

>The rapid, widespread business adoption of cloud computing has created an immense and leading demand for related skills in the tech job market, surpassing even the demand for skills in artificial intelligence and machine learning.

_Analogy:_ _The demand for cloud skills is like the California Gold Rush of the 1850s. The discovery of gold (the cloud's capabilities) was the initial event, but the massive, sustained economic boom came from the demand for people with the skills to support the rush: prospectors (cloud engineers), toolmakers (DevOps specialists), and town builders (cloud architects). The value wasn't just in the gold itself, but in the entire ecosystem of skills needed to find, extract, and use it._

**Where it breaks down:** A gold rush is finite; the gold eventually runs out. The demand for cloud skills is not based on a finite resource but on evolving technology, meaning the required skills will likely transform and create new demands rather than disappear.

## Details

The migration of business infrastructure and services to the cloud is not just a technological shift; it has fundamentally reshaped the job market. According to key industry trackers like Indeed and LinkedIn in early 2020, cloud computing emerged as one of the most, if not the most, in-demand hard skill for companies, highlighting its critical importance over other prominent fields like AI. This surge has a direct [[Cloud - Impact on Data Roles|impact on data roles]], creating new specializations and requirements.

#### Primary Goal

To highlight the market evidence that demonstrates the critical, high-priority need for professionals with cloud computing expertise.

#### Mechanism


- **How it Works:** The demand is a direct market reaction to a technological paradigm shift. As companies move from on-premise servers to cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP), they create a skills gap. They need a workforce capable of designing, building, and maintaining applications on this new infrastructure, leading to a surge in job postings that list cloud skills as a primary requirement.
- **Industry Ranking (Indeed):**
    - In February 2020, the employment search engine Indeed identified cloud computing as the single most in-demand skill listed in its job postings.
- **Industry Ranking (LinkedIn):**
    - LinkedIn's analysis identified cloud computing as the second most sought-after hard skill by companies, ranking it only behind blockchain.
- **Comparative Demand:**
    - Crucially, both analyses placed the demand for cloud computing skills higher than that for artificial intelligence and machine learning skills, underscoring its foundational importance in the current tech landscape.

## Questions

- Given the high cost and competition for hiring experienced cloud talent, how would you advise a startup to balance the immediate need for cloud expertise with the long-term goal of building an in-house, sustainable cloud engineering culture?
- As a company's cloud usage scales from a single application to a multi-regional, multi-account enterprise deployment, how does the demand for specific cloud skills (e.g., security, networking, FinOps) evolve, and how would you proactively plan for this skills evolution?
- What if a disruptive technology emerged that made cloud infrastructure management completely autonomous and 'invisible' to developers? Which cloud-related skills would become obsolete, and which would become even more critical?
