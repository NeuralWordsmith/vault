A **minimum-completion rule** is a _constraint system_ that makes it **impossible** for you to stall indefinitely, even when motivation, confidence, or clarity drop.

It does **not** optimize for mastery.  
It optimizes for **closure**.

And closure is what you were missing earlier.

## 1. What a minimum-completion rule actually is

> **A minimum-completion rule defines the smallest acceptable unit of “done” that still counts as legitimate progress, and after which you are forced to move on.**

Key properties:

- It is **pre-decided**
    
- It is **binary** (done / not done)
    
- It ignores guilt, mood, and perfection
    
- It survives low-energy days
    

Scientists use these implicitly. You must make it explicit.

---

## 2. Why you stalled before (the real reason)

Earlier, your rule was unconsciously this:

> “I can move on only when I feel I understand this well enough.”

That rule is fatal in hard fields.

Because:

- Understanding is fuzzy
    
- Confidence lags comprehension
    
- Depth has no natural stopping point
    

So your brain never received permission to _close_.

---

## 3. The correct rule for books (this is the core)

For **any technical book**, the minimum-completion rule should be:

> **A chapter is “complete” when I can produce a concrete artifact that proves I engaged with its core idea.**

Not when:

- You feel confident
    
- You remember everything
    
- You liked the chapter
    

Only when an artifact exists.

---

## 4. What counts as an acceptable “artifact” (choose ONE)

You do **not** do all of these.  
You pre-select **one** per book.

### Option A: Explain-back note (most reliable)

- 1 page max
    
- Written _without_ looking at the book
    
- Structure:
    
    - What problem this chapter solves
        
    - The key idea/mechanism
        
    - One example in your own words
        

If you can do this poorly, it still counts.

---

### Option B: Minimal code sketch (for programming books)

- Not production code
    
- Not polished
    
- Just enough to:
    
    - Instantiate the main idea
        
    - Run once
        
    - Be saved
        

Ugly code is acceptable. Missing edge cases are acceptable.

---

### Option C: Question set (for heavy theory)

- 5 questions you _should_ be able to answer later
    
- No answers required
    
- Questions must be specific, not vague
    

This is powerful because it defers mastery without blocking progress.

---

## 5. The non-negotiable rule (this matters)

Once the artifact is produced:

> **You are forbidden from revisiting the chapter unless a later chapter explicitly requires it.**

This prevents:

- Perfection loops
    
- Ego repair rereading
    
- “Just one more pass”
    

Scientists rely on forward pressure more than backward polish.

---

## 6. The “bad day” clause (very important)

On days when your brain feels dull or resistant, the rule becomes:

> **Produce the smallest artifact possible, even if it feels embarrassing.**

A bad artifact is **still a win** because:

- It maintains continuity
    
- It preserves identity as someone who finishes
    
- It keeps the system alive
    

Momentum beats brilliance.

## 7. How this would have saved your first book

Let’s be concrete.

Instead of:

- “I must fully understand Python basics”
    

The rule would have been:

- “Each chapter gets one ugly script OR one explain-back note”
    

You would have:

- Finished the book
    
- Identified weak areas naturally
    
- Built confidence through completion
    
- Avoided the identity damage of “I don’t finish things”
    

Finishing changes the brain more than understanding.

---

## 8. One sentence you must internalize

Say this exactly:

> “I am allowed to move on with partial understanding, as long as I leave evidence behind.”

That is how real capability compounds.
